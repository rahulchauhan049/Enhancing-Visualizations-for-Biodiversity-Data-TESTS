There are many visualizations availble in R which can be used to represent data in graphical manner.

It is always easier to understand data using visualizations. For example: Georeferenced record of specied can be visulaised using map. 
'bdvis' is a famous tool that provide some visualization for biodiversity data.


Here's report on different visualizations not covered in bdvis that can be used in biodiversity researches.



##: Geographical DATA


There are various ways to plot geographical data. Geographical Data includes Latitude and Longitude Data which can be plotted On maps.

> Some ways of visualizing Geographical Data are Discussed below:

**Heat Maps**

In heat map, the area with more number of items become more red than other. It is great to visualise the population in a perticular area.

##: Data Which contain Temporal information

bdvis Has 'temporal' function to plot time related Data. But there can also be other ways.

> Some ways of visualizing Time Data are Discussed below:

**1. Line Graph**

A line Graph is the simplest way to represent time series data. Line Graph is easy to create, and helps the viewer get a qucik sense of how Something has changes over time.


In biodiversity data, a line Graph can show how population chages over years.

**2.Bar Charts**

Bar Charts represent data as horizontal or vertical bars. The length of each bar is proportional to the value of the variable at theat point in time.

In Biodiversity data, bar charts can help to view density of different speices in pertiular year.

**3.Polar Area Diagram**

The function of Polar area Diagram is somewhat similar to 'temporal' function in 'bdvis'.

Sometimes, time series data can be cyclical - a season in a year, time of the day, and so on. Polar area diagrams help represent the cyclical nature time series data.

##: Occurance Data

Here we can use different visualizations to inspect occurance data. Here we find out which species, remark are more and which are less in numbers.

**Word Cloud**

Word cloud is the way to visualize which category is more and which is less.
